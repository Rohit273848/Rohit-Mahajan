# Rohit Mahajan's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project is a simple, clean, and responsive web portfolio built to showcase my skills, background, and future goals as a web developer.

## 🚀 Overview

This portfolio features essential sections like Home, About, and Contact. It is designed with a minimalist layout using HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS. The goal was to build a responsive and elegant site to represent my work and technical journey.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- CSS  
- Tailwind CSS  

## 📄 Features 
- Smooth and minimal layout  
- Home page with introduction  
- Resume added as PNG image  
- Custom social icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, Instagram, and X  
- Static assets included (PNG format icons)

> 📌 Note: SVG icons were not used in this repo as I learned that GitHub doesn't preview SVGs reliably. PNGs were used instead.
